# 2boi's Tome of Druidry
This mod is an addon for Iron's Spells and Spellbooks, expanding the nature school of magic with more focus on environmental interaction.

## Planned Features
### Spells
The core mod’s nature magic specializes in damage over time and debuffing. This addon builds on that, adding environmental interaction as a key element. Here's what’s planned for version 1:

#### Farming Spells
- **Fertilizing Breat**h (*Done*): Sprays a cone of bonemeal, boosting plant growth.
- **Aphrodisiac** (*Planned*): Forces two mobs to breed without needing a specific item. Handy for mass breeding.

#### Trap/Passive Defense Spells
- **Hidden Boombloom** (*Done*): Turns a flower into a landmine that explodes when something gets too close.
- **Meadow Minefield** (*Done*): Summons a temporary field of Boomblooms.
- **Bumbleguard** (*Planned*): Cast this on a beehive to turn it into a guard hive. Aggressive bees will attack hostile mobs and players, and respawn as long as there's honey or sugar. More spellpower = more bees.

#### Utility Spells
- **Metrolomagic** (*Planned*): Change the weather. Other players can interrupt the spell to stop you.
- **Dendrologistics** (*Planned*): Cast on a log to create a shared storage system. Each tree type gets two access points, offering more space than an Ender Chest but less convenience.

#### Movement Spells
- **Instant Menhir** (*Planned*): Summons a rock from the ground, knocking creatures into the air. Knockback direction depends on where you're looking.
- **Vineshot** (*Planned*): A vine grapples creatures to you or pulls you toward a block. Basically, a grappling hook.

#### Damage Spells
- **Telekinetic Slingshot** (*Planned*): Break a natural block, then fling its fragments at enemies for damage based on the block type.
- **Beeline** (*Future Version*): Like the wither skull spell, but fires a bee that explodes on impact and poisons enemies.

### Gear
- **Druid Robes** (*Planned*): Classic druid garb.
- **Battleent Armor** (*Planned*): Armor made from enchanted treent bark. Craftable after beating the treent boss.
- **Pocket Menhir** (*Future Version*): A full-sized menhir for your belt slot. No idea what it does yet, but it's funny.
- **Hoglin Skull Helmet**(*Future Version*): Looks badass, that’s all.

### Blocks
- **Menhir** (*Future Version*): Right-click with an upgrade core to reduce spellpower for that school of magic within range.

### Mobs
- **Treent** (*Planned*): A boss. Find a wither-rotted heart in the Nether, place it in a dead treent’s husk to awaken it in its corrupted form. Beat it, and it becomes a peaceful mob.
- **Hulder** (*Future Version*): Tricksy forest creatures that turn into horrors when below Y=0.
